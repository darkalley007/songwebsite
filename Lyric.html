            Climb on board
            Climb on board
            We'll go slow and high tempo
            Light and dark


            Hold me hard and mellow
            I'm seeing the pain, seeing the pleasure
            Nobody but you, 'body but me
            'Body but us, bodies together


            I love to hold you close, tonight and always
            I love to wake up next to you
            So we'll piss off the neighbours
            In the place that feels the tears
            The place to lose your fears


            Yeah, reckless behavior
            A place that is so pure, so dirty and raw
            In the bed all day, bed all day, bed all day
            Fucking in and fighting on
            It's our paradise and it's our war zone
            It's our paradise and it's our war zone


            Paradise
            War Zone
            Paradise
            War Zone
